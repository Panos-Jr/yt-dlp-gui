# yt-dlp-gui
Simple GUI application using the yt-dlp library in Python (yt-dlp is `a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes` <a href='https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp'>GitHub repository here</a>) with a basic user interface for selecting audio or video download.

## Download
You can download the GUI yt-dlp application from the `Releases`:

## Functionality
The application is simple, for an average user to download a youtube video, either the audio or video (to clarify, the video will have audio), in a folder (which will be created automatically) in your Desktop, called `downloads`. For now, the interface is being developed, with more necessary functionality being added.
