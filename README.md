Simple GUI application using the yt-dlp library in Python (yt-dlp is `a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes`, <a href='https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp'>GitHub repository here</a>) with a basic user interface for selecting audio or video download.

## Download
You can download it from `Releases`:

## Requirements (from v1.3)
FFmpeg is required from v1.3, <a href='https://www.ffmpeg.org/'>FFmpeg</a>.

## Functionality
The application is simple, for an average user to download a youtube video, either the audio or the video (the video with audio). For now, the interface is being developed, with more necessary functionality being added.
